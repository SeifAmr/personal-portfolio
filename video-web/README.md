## Project Name: 
Tutoruu: An Academic Guide

## Synopsis of 'Tutoruu: An Academic Guide': 

An underclass student is overwhelmed by an unbearable workload; hence he finds help by using an app called Tutoruu.

### What is Our Project About?

An interactive web and film experience where the user tries to help the student tackle their workload. However, their efforts are not sufficient and the student eventually finds the tutoring app Tutoruu.  

### The Overall Concept and Theme:

A student is struggling and overwhelmed with their classes/assignments/projects and is trying to find ways to get help. They try different solutions such as getting help from the Professor/TA, checking Google and contacting classmates. However nothing helps. They then try Tutoruu the app. On the app they are able to find different tutors that took the same class theyâ€™re struggling in and text them if they can really help with their problem. They then meet with a tutor and finally they succeed at finishing their assignment and he/she is relieved.

### Desired Experience:

By being able to make the decisions to help the student, we hope the user will in some way empathize with the protagonist. Moreover, if the user is potentially a student they may be able to find the app helpful by connecting them with tutors. 

## Process: 

### Brainstorming Phase:

We began the process by brainstorming a storyline to use. Seif and his partner Youssef having launched the app Tutoruu, suggested having a film to highlight the usefulness of the app. We then drew an outline of the various scenes, separating them into Beginning, Midpoint Escalation and Conclusion. We also identified the various decision options for each scene. Then we divided the roles into those focusing on filming, Sadeq and Seif, and the website, Rhea and Moyo. And then we began working on our respective parts. 

### Video's Production:


The videography of this project was engaging because it allowed us to experiment and learn new methods by using a DSLR, Gimball, and GoPro. Initially, We thought of critical elements that would embed key characteristics to our character's P.O.V. and background. For this aspect to be accomplished, we conducted some research on character traits and the correlation of characters to space in cinematography. By understanding the different viewpoints, we planned to have the first P.O.V. (from the GoPro) and a third P.O.V (from Sony A7III). 'Handheld' shots were an option that we thought about, although it is ideal for action performance rather than an advertisement, such as in our case. Hence, a Gimball was an ideal solution for a steady reveal that prevented a distribution of (the character to space relationship) pacing. 
Additionally, we implemented an even ratio of static to dynamic shots in our video; we thought this process would ease the logistics of pace and rhythm in post-production. Lastly, lighting was a vital component in our video as we considered daylights and indoor lights. We learned throughout our filming that lights were necessary because of how they control the contrast and appeal of a character in a frame.

### Video's Post-Production:

The editing and sound design of the video were interesting because we acknowledged how this stage of production could change our ideas from the production of the video. For instance, we faced difficulties in post-production because we were limited to a few footage because of the actor's availability. We thought of integrating an experimental pace and sound design in the final scene. Initially, the final scene was composed of three shots, although due to synchronizing issues with the application's demo and two acts of scene 1, we had to think of alternatives that make sense for an advertisement. Thus, we used shots from past videos in the last scene to emphasize a sense of a journey from Ali's perspective. We learned that time in filmmaking could be stretched and manipulated to establish new meanings for an original story from this attempt. Lastly, we thought of implementing the kuleshov effect in the emailing and googling scenes. For instance, we see Ali's P.O.V. as per the emails or google. The relationship of these elements creates tension, as described by the dynamic change of pace and emotions revealed by the GoPro.



### Website

For the website we started off by coming up with a wireframe of how we wanted the website to look. Then we finally implemented it. 

#### Moyo

The primary focus was interactivity. We worked on ensuring that the correct videos were played depending on what option the user chose. We also had to ensure the other option was invisible if only one option was left. When creating the website, We largely followed the scheme that Seif already had on his website, and added our video and interactivity components.
