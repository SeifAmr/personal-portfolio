# SOUNDS LIKE

### Group Members: Moyo, Yunho, Seif, Rhea
## Project Name: Time Traveller

## Project Description:
### What is it?
"Time Traveller" is a website that provides the viewer with an auitory experience of technology through time.
### Overall Concept and Theme
The concept of "Time Traveller" is to take the viewer through an auditory experience of each era of technical innovation since the dawn of man. As the user scrolls, they travel from the Stone Age, to the Steel and Iron Age, the Medieval and Renaissance Period, the Industrial Age, the Modern Age and finally the possibility of the Future. It is also supplemented by a thermometer and a beeping sound, to remind the viewer that despite our technological innovation, we have also experienced constant global warming. Therefore, bearing innovation as well as its side-effects, we must consider "What's Next" and understand that, it is something "We Decide"

### Desired Experience
The desired experience is one of the visualization of each period through sound. Each period is supplemented by an image as well as a soundscape of the period. Thus the user, can use these to further expand and completely imagine what the period was like and see the differences is time continues on. Moreover, we wanted to encourage awareness using the beeping, so although the viewer is to enjoy man's innovation, there is still an awareness of it's consequences.

## Process:
### Brainstorming
We began by meeting to come up with an initial idea. Seif had suggested using the natural elements, including animals, humans and how they've caused sound pollution and ruined the sounds of nature. We built on that by considering what caused the pollution, humanity's dirve for technological innovation, and we decided that this could be shown through sound. To keep that element of human destruction, we decided to add the thermometer as an active reminder.


### Audio
#### Moyo


#### Yunho
I worked mainly on mixing the sound samples provided by Moyo with some no copyright background music to enhance the user's experience. My main aim was to make the sound feel as if the user is actually in the middle of the scene. By adding a multiple layer of the same sound samples with different volumes, the sound provides a sense of distance (sound from away and close).


### Website
#### Seif
I worked on implementing the sound transition between each era. Initially I had many ideas to implement this, one way at looking at it was implementing flags in the center of each image through out the website and playing and pausing the appropriate sound as the scroll reaches the center of each of those images. However, I then wanted it to have a more seamless feeling as though the user is walking through time. Therefore, I started working on implementing a fade and fade out volume animate as it reaches each of the centers. But this even didn't provide the effect that we envisioned. Which then made me inspired me to have a top and bottom border that would appropriately allow us to fade out the previous sound as soon as we are going down to the bottom of the previouse image and going to the next image (the top of the next image). Unfortunately, in the end we realized that the sound animations I created wasn't working on Chrome, but working on safari. So we developed a click on image to listen to sound on Chrome.

#### Rhea
I worked on implementing the website design and animations. As we had met and come up with a basic design, I created the web page, added the images and used the AOS library to addd fade ins. Then I worked on the thermometer. The desired effect was to have it "fill" as you scrolled along, to signal that although we've experienced technological innovation throughout the eras, that has been supplemented by a rise in our global temperatures. Initially it filled from the bottom, but I could only figure out how to do that with one color. So the alternative that I found was to have a coloured image of the thermometer, and then have an overlying rectangle, that got smaller as you scrolled along.

## Reflection/Evaluation:
We wanted to keep the website simple and encourage a focus on the sound, which we believe we accomplished. However to be honest, the sound was a bit difficult to tackle, particularly as we had wanted to do a fade in and fade for each sound as you scrolled on.

Room for improvement:
- Potentially having pause and play, for each sound, as well as a sound bar, so the viewer can see how much time there is left.
- Adding a volume button to control the loudness of the sound
