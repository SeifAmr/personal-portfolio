Project Name: A Student's Journey

Discription: The movie is about 4 human beings at NYUAD talking about their journey in either freshmen, sophmore, junior or senior year. One can see each person's perception of University and how it changes by time. The website not only depicts these stories into a lesson of "We run at different paces because we have different journies" but also encourages students to find themselves by self reflecting and pacing themselves according to their own needs.

Process: I picked the theme and the light colors in accordance to what I want students to feel when they open the website. I want them to feel reassurance and relevance to their feelings. I tried to make the website as soothing as possible and included very few words as possible. Even when i included text i hid it as an overlay over a picture when the mouse hovers over the image.

Reflection: I started my idea in accordance to the wireframe I have created erlier, but as i was putting things together I felt like the colors may have looked too professionel and that wasnt the point of my website. I wanted something easy to the eye and calming, thats when i chose the light blue color. Also, in my wireframe there were more text but I also felt like I wanted to change that because it wouldn't have conveyed what I wanted in the right way.
